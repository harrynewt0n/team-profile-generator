Use the command 'node index.js' to initialise the application. From here you can follow the prompts in the command-line, using the arrow keys where required. You'll begin by giving details of the team manager, followed by the option to add additional team profiles. Once your team is complete, simply select 'I dont want to add anymore team members' and a team.html file will be generated and stored in the 'output' folder.
